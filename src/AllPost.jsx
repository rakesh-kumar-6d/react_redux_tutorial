//Additionally, connect can do more. It can give you access to your state which is living inside your store object. 
//To get access to your state, we need to use a special function called mapStateToProps.
// This function does exactly what it is named, map the state from the store object to the props object in your components. 
//==================================================================================
//The argument to mapStateToProps is our application state. To understand this better, 
//imagine whatever you pass inside the mapStateToProps argument is your state. 
//Next question to ask is what is that state is it an array or an object or something else? 
//Well that will depend on what you have defined it in your reducer.
